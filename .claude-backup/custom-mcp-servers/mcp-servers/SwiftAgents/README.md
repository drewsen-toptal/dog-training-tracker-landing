# SwiftAgents

This repository contains an AGENTS.md file aimed at Swift and SwiftUI developers using LLMs with their projects. It’s designed to avoid a number of common problems in AI-generated Swift code, based on [the original list in this article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/281/what-to-fix-in-ai-generated-swift-code).

**The rules very strongly focus on using new API, targeting iOS 26 and later.** If you need to support older versions of iOS or other Apple platforms, you’ll need to adjust the rules a little.

Contributions are welcome – please open PRs as needed.
