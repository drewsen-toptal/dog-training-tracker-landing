## Competitor Keyword Analysis

### Top Competitors & Their Positioning

| App | Name Strategy | Subtitle Focus |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| Dogo | Brand + Category | "Dog & Puppy Training" |
| Puppr | Brand only | "Dog Training & Tricks" |
| Woofz | Brand (playful) | "Puppy & Dog Training" |
| GoodPup | Brand (emotional) | "Dog Training at Home" |
| Pupford | Brand | "Dog & Puppy Training" |

### Keyword Gaps (Opportunities)

- `offline` - none mention offline capability
- `one-time` / `no subscription` - none mention pricing model
- `tracker` / `log` / `journal` - progress tracking angle
- `unlimited dogs` - multi-dog support
- `no account` - privacy angle

**Your strongest differentiation keywords:**
1. "Pay Once" / "One-Time"
2. "Offline"
3. "Tracker" / "Progress"
4. "Unlimited Dogs"
