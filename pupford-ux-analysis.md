## 8. UX WEAKNESSES & GAPS

### 8.1 Critical UX Issues

**1. Missing Progress & Homework Logging**
- **Issue:** "There's no way to log how your dog did or daily homework"
- **Impact:** Users can't track granular progress (e.g., "fluency improved from 3/10 to 7/10")
- **User Burden:** Must remember progress mentally or use external tools
- **Missed Opportunity:** No data-driven insights into training effectiveness

**2. No Spaced Repetition System**
- **Issue:** "Previous lessons are not brought back up"
- **Impact:** Users must manually remember to practice earlier behaviors
- **Learning Science Gap:** Spaced repetition is proven effective for skill retention
- **Result:** Risk of skill degradation as users progress to new lessons

**3. Limited Individualized Support**
- **Issue:** "The app lacks individualized support"
- **Impact:** Generic advice may not address unique dog/owner situations
- **Subscription Dependency:** "Requires a subscription to access most content, limiting user assistance"
- **Frustration:** "Room for improvement in providing individual attention"

**4. Subscription Paywall Confusion**
- **Issue:** Basic courses free, but "subscription to access most content"
- **Pricing Tiers:** Multiple options (monthly $9.99, semi-annual, lifetime $199.99)
- **Unclear Value:** Not immediately obvious what's free vs. paid
- **User Complaint:** "Limiting user assistance" due to paywall

**5. Inconsistent Cross-Day Practice**
- **Issue:** "You learn something new each day, but you have to remember what you've already learned"
- **Cognitive Load:** Users must manage practice schedule across all 30+ behaviors
- **No Smart Reminders:** App doesn't prompt practice of specific older lessons
- **Result:** Skills learned on Day 5 may be forgotten by Day 25

**6. Shallow Progress Visualization**
- **Current State:** Can mark days complete and rate progress
- **Missing:** Visual progress graphs, behavior mastery indicators, consistency streaks
- **Impact:** Harder to see long-term improvement patterns
- **Motivation Gap:** Lacks gamification elements that drive engagement

**7. Community Fragmentation**
- **Issue:** Community hosted on external Facebook platform
- **Friction:** Users must leave app to access community
- **Barrier:** Not all users have/want Facebook accounts
- **Missed Data:** Community interactions don't inform app recommendations

**8. Undefined Desensitization UX**
- **Issue:** Sound library UI/interaction patterns not well-documented
- **Questions:** How do users schedule sound training? Can they create playlists? Volume automation?
- **Impact:** Unclear if feature is as polished as core course content

**9. Shop Integration Pressure**
- **Concern:** "Zak George Recommended Products" may feel sales-focused
- **Trust Risk:** Users may perceive training advice as product marketing
- **Balancing Act:** Need to separate educational content from commerce clearly

**10. No Social Proof Within Training**
- **Missing:** Other users' success stories within specific lessons
- **Opportunity:** "1,247 dogs mastered this behavior this week" could motivate
- **Isolation:** Users don't see peers progressing alongside them in app
